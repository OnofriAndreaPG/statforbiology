Authors@R: c(person("Andrea", "Onofri", role = c("aut", "cre"), 
    email = "andrea.onofri@unipg.it"))
Description: Contains several tools for nonlinear regression analyses and general data analysis in biology and agriculture. Contains also datasets for practicing and teaching purposes. Supports the blog: Onofri (2024) "Fixing the bridge between biologists and statisticians" <https://www.statforbiology.com> and the book: Onofri (2024) "Experimental Methods in Agriculture" <https://www.statforbiology.com/_statbookeng/>. The blog is a collection of short articles aimed at improving the efficiency of communication between biologists and statisticians, as pointed out in Kozak (2016) <doi:10.1590/0103-9016-2015-0399>, spreading a better awareness of the potential usefulness, beauty and limitations of biostatistic.
